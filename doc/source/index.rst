Python bindings for SFML
========================
.. note ::

        So far, these bindings have only been tested thoroughly on Linux,
        though minimal testing has been done on Windows.

This is version |version| of the unofficial Python bindings for `SFML2`_,
based on `the first release candidate` and is made available under the terms of
the `LGPLv3`_ license.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the Python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia software.

These bindings were created in large part by Jonathan DeWachter, with
significant contributions from Edwin Marshall. Other contributors include 
Jorge Araya Navarro and Richard Sims. Of course, this bindnig wouldn't have
been made possible without the work of Laurent Gomilla and Bastien LÃ©onard.

What's new ?
============

**1 October 2012**: sfeMovie
----------------------------

`sfeMovie <http://lucas.soltic.perso.luminy.univmed.fr/sfeMovie/>`_ has been
ported to Python. For documentation and installation instructions, please
consult the `website <http://openhelbreath/python-sfeMovie>`_. Just as the
original project depends on SFML being installed, the new sfeMovie bindings
depend on these SFML bindings.

**18 November 2012**: New setup script
--------------------------------------

In addition to migrating from distutils to distribute, a new command has been
added which allows developers to launch the unit test suite::

   python setup.py test

**16 Juny 2012**: Deprecated some methods
-----------------------------------------

`save_to_file()`, `open_from_*()` and `load_from_*()` methods have been deprecated 
in favor of `from_*()` and `to_file()`.

In addition, `copy()` methods have been deprecated in favor of Python's
`__copy__()` special methods. 

Next Version
============
Version 1.2.1 will concentrate on fixing bugs that were unresolved in the
|release| release and packaging the bindings for various platforms. 
In addition, it will be the first version to `officially support Mac OS X`_.

For more specific details about what is planned and what has been accomplished,
please visit the `issues page on github` and the :doc:`changelog </changelog>`, 
respectively.
