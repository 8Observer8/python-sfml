SFML2 for Python
================
This is the version 1.1 of a non-official python binding for SFML2 
released under the GPLv3 license.

A python binding really is the perfect way to sketch a software using 
SFML.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to build quickly multimedia software.

.. note ::

	This binding has so far been tested on Linux and partially on 
	Window, but the examples do run well on Windows.
