SFML2 for Python
================
This is version |version| of an unofficial python binding for SFML2 
released under the `LGPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html>`_ license.

A python binding really is the perfect way to sketch a software using 
SFML.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia software.

.. note ::

        So far, this binding has only been tested thoroughly on Linux,
        though minimal testing has been done on Windows.
