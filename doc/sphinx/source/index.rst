SFML2 for Python
================

.. image:: sfml2-logo.png

This is an non-official python binding for SFML 2.

A python binding is really the perfect way to sketch a software using SFML.

People who come from SFML2 in C++ should be familiar with this binding
as well. Nevertless, there are some minor differences from the official
SFML design but they are minor and well-explained. You really shouldn't
be afraid of those because it's just a matter of beauty that Python can
offer to us.


.. WARNING::

   Big modifications in the design have been recently made in SFML2 but 
   this is too early to keep this binding up-to-date with because theese 
   modifications are subjet to change. People shouldn't use the very lastest
   version for their serious project and should wait instead. That's why
   this binding will stand on its previous version.
