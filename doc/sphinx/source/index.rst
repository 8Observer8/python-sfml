SFML2 for Python
================
This is the version 1.0 of an non-official python binding for SFML 2.0 
released under the license GPLv3.

A python binding is really the perfect way to sketch a software using SFML.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to build quickly multimedia software.

.. note ::
	This binding has been so far tested on Linux platform and partially on 
	Window, but the examples run well on Windows.
