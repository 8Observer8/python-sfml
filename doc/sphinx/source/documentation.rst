Documentation
=============

Here you will find the documentation of the project. It's mainly a translation from the original SFML2's documentation.

.. WARNING::
   I didn't have time to end the documentation. I focused the graphics module and everything in, except sf.View, sf.Text and the missing sf.HandledWindow should be well documented.
