Documentation
=============

Here you will find the project's documentation. It's mainly a translation from the original SFML2's documentation.

.. WARNING::
   I didn't have time to end the documentation. I focused on the graphics 
   module and everything in it, apart from sf.View, sf.Text and the 
   missing sf.HandledWindow, should be well documented.
