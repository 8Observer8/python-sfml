Getting started
===============
I suggest you to read the introduction before downloading and installing.

Getting the module
-----------------
1) Compiling

First, download the source ball from http://foobar.com.

Then you must compile, to do that, you must have cython 0.16 and the 
sfml git version which was avalaible on the 20th November 2011.

Cython 0.16: http://cython.org/

SFML 1.9 (devlopement version): http://openhelbreath.net/sfml1.9

Here are the commands which will compile and install pySFML2! ::

   sudo python setup.py install 
   sudo python3 setup.py install

2) Ubuntu

For Ubuntu 12.04 users, just type ::

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sonkun/sfml
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python-sfml2

.. WARNING::
    The following commands install the lastest version available. So far
    it's the 0.9 but soon the 1.0 will be released.
