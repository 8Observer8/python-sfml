Python bindings for SFML
========================
.. note ::

        So far, these bindings have only been tested thoroughly on Linux,
        though minimal testing has been done on Windows.

This is version |version| of the unofficial Python bindings for `SFML`_,
based on `the first release candidate` and is made available under the terms of
the `LGPLv3`_ license.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the Python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia software.

These bindings were created in large part by Jonathan De Wachter, with
significant contributions from Edwin Marshall. Other contributors include 
Jorge Araya Navarro and Richard Sims. Of course, this binding wouldn't have
been made possible without the work of Laurent Gomilla and Bastien LÃ©onard.
