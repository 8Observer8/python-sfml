About
=====
These are Python bindings for `SFML <http://www.sfml-dev.org/>`_, made available
under the terms of the `zlib/libpng <http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib>`_ license.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the Python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia software.

Getting the Code
================
After you've installed `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, you may issue
the following command to obtain the source::

    git clone git@github.com:Sonkun/python-sfml.git
    cd python-sfml

The source from the add-ons projects are available as submodules, which may be
obtained by issuing the following additional commands::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Alternatively, you may clone the main project and its submodules all at once
with the following command::

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/Sonkun/python-sfml.git
    cd python-sfml
