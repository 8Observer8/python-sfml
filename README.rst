About
=====
This is version |version| of the unofficial Python bindings for `SFML2 <http://www.sfml-dev.org/>`_ 
released under the `LGPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html>`_ license.

Python bindings really are the perfect way to sketch software using SFML.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the Python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia software.

.. note ::

        So far, these bindings have only been tested thoroughly on Linux,
        though minimal testing has been done on Windows.

Getting the Code
================
After you've installed `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, you may issue
the following command to obtain the source::

    git clone git@github.com:Sonkun/python-sfml2.git

The source from the add-ons projects are available as submodules, which may be
obtained by issuing the following additional commands::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
