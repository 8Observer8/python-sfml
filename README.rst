This is version 2.3.2 of the official Python bindings for SFML, based on
SFML 2.3.2, and is made available under the terms of the zlib/libpng
license.

As for most of Python projects, the easiest way to get the latest stable
version is through PyPi. Just issue the following command in a terminal::

    pip install pysfml

You might want to work with the development version in which case you
have to compile by yourself. First, obtain the source::

    git clone https://github.com/Sonkun/python-sfml.git
    cd python-sfml

Then, compiling is simply a matter of `python setup.py install` in  a
terminal after you installed the dependencies which are Cython and SFML
itself.
