This is an non-official python binding for SFML2.

It was forked from the official python binding created by 
Bastien LÃ©onard the 16th of November 2011 to suit my own needs.

It has since then widely improved and I decided to share my work under
a new license: GPLv3

For all information about the project (installing, compiling source, 
documentation), you may want to loop up
