This is the version 1.2 of a non-official python binding for SFML2 
released under the LGPLv3 license. This version is based on the first 
release candidate of SFML2.

This binding is complete as it provides all classes found in SFML and 
all its features. The module is split into five distinct sub-modules: 
system, window, graphics, audio and network.

Unlike the official one this binding provides the network module in 
order to be exhaustive although its use is discouraged in favor of the
implementation included in python's standard library.

Examples, tutorials and complete documentation come along to help 
you with using pySFML2.

A python binding really is the perfect way to sketch software using 
SFML.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to build quickly multimedia software.

The bug-tracker is temporarily read-only. If you find bugs then please 
report them on the forum or via the issues tab on the github page, I'll 
add them.
