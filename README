This is a non-official python binding for SFML2.

It was forked from the official python binding created by 
Bastien Leonard the 16th of November 2011 to suit my own needs.

It has since then widely improved and I decided to share my work under
a new license: GPLv3

This version (1.0) is a fast release and is compatible with the first 
release candidate of SFML2.

For all information about the project (installing, compiling source, 
documentation), you may want to loop up 
http://openhelbreath.net/python-sfml2/0.1/doc/

The bug-tracker is temporarily read-only  so if you want to report 
issues, you can do it on the github page of the project itself, I'll 
add them.
