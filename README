This is an non-official python 3 binding for SFML 2.

It was forked from the official python binding created by 
Bastien LÃ©onard the 16th of November 2011 to suit my own needs.

It has since then widely improved and I decided to share my work under
a new license: GPLv3

I'm going to complete this README...
